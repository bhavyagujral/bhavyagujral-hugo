I’m a freelance Android developer, specializing in native Android apps. Ever since I built my first Android app during the final year of my studies, I have a passion for mobile apps. By the way, check out my [awesome work](#work).

I create Android apps that follow the Android design guidelines and fit into the Android design ecosystem but with enough breathing room for a distinct branding.

I’m interested in all kinds of cool and challenging projects but I’m especially interested in apps that make use of the user’s context (location, activity etc) to provide a magical experience. No matter what your project or idea is though, do get in touch so we can have a chat and see if we’re a fit.

If you’re looking to hire a freelance Android developer to create a brand new Android app, need to make changes, add features, fix bugs to an existing app or simply need someone to bounce ideas off of, get in touch! I look forward to hearing from you!
